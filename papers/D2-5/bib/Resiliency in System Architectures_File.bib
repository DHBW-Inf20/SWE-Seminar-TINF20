 abstract = {Organizations in every sector-industry, government, and academia-are facing increasingly complex operational environments and dynamic risk environments. These demands conspire to force organizations to rethink how they manage operational risk and the resilience of critical business processes and services. The CERT Resilience Management Model CERT -RMM is an innovative and transformative way to approach the challenge of managing operational resilience in complex, risk-evolving environments. It is the result of years of research into the ways that organizations manage the security and survivability of the assets that ensure mission success. It incorporates concepts from an established process improvement community to allow organizations to holistically mature their security, business continuity, and IT operations management capabilities and improve predictability and success in sustaining operations whenever disruption occurs. This report describes the models key concepts, components, and process area relationships and provides guidance for applying the model to meet process improvement and other objectives. One process area is included in its entirety the others are presented in outline form. All of the CERT-RMM process areas are available for download at www.cert.orgresilience.},

 abstract = {The economy and well-being of modern societies relies on complex and interdependent infrastructure systems to enable delivery of utilities and movement of goods, people and services. This complexity has resulted in an increased potential for cascading failures, whereby small scale initial failures in one system can result in events of catastrophic proportions across the wider network. Resilience and the emerging concept of resilience engineering within infrastructure are among the main concerns of those managing such complex systems. However, the disparate nature of resilience engineering development in various academic and industrial regimes has resulted in a diversity of definitions and characterisations. These are discussed in this paper, as are the commonalities between sectors and between different engineering disciplines. The paper also highlights the various methodologies used as part of resilience engineering implementation and monitoring, current practices including existing approaches and metrics, and an insight into the opportunities and potential barriers associated with these methodologies and practices. This research was undertaken for the Resilience Shift initiative to shift the approach to resilience in practice for critical infrastructure sectors. The programme aims to help practitioners involved in critical infrastructure to make decisions differently, contributing to a safer and better world.},

 abstract = {Emergent paradigms of Industry~4.0 and Industrial Internet of Things expect cyber-physical systems to reliably provide services overcoming disruptions in operative conditions and adapting to changes in architectural and functional requirements. In this paper, we describe a hardware/software framework supporting operation and maintenance of software-controlled systems enhancing resilience by promoting a Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) process to automatically derive structural configurations and failure models from reliability artifacts. Specifically, a reflective architecture developed around digital twins enables representation and control of system Configuration Items properly derived from SysML Block Definition Diagrams, providing support for variation. Besides, a plurality of distributed analytic agents for qualitative evaluation over executable failure models empowers the system with runtime self-assessment and dynamic adaptation capabilities. We describe the framework architecture outlining roles and responsibilities in a System of Systems perspective, providing salient design traits about digital twins and data analytic agents for failure propagation modeling and analysis. We discuss a prototype implementation following the MDE approach, highlighting self-recovery and self-adaptation properties on a real cyber-physical system for vehicle access control to Limited Traffic Zones.},
