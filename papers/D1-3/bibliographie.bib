@inproceedings{ANG.2006,
 abstract = {This paper provides a brief overview of service-oriented architecture (SOA) and an explanation of how the Department of Defense Architecture Framework (DoDAF) can be used to describe a SOA. DoDAF uses IEEE 1471 definition of an architecture description to define a standard approach to describing, presenting, and integrating a DoD architecture that can be used with a service oriented approach to capability based planning. The principal objective of the Framework is to ensure that architecture descriptions can be compared and related across organizational boundaries, including Joint and multi-national boundaries. SOA is an architectural approach to application integration that enables flexible connectivity of applications or resources implemented as services. Such services have well-defined, platform-independent specifications that hide the underlying technical complexity of the environment (encapsulation), are self-contained (loosely coupled), and reusable. Capability based planning involves identifying required capabilities, their desired effects, and the ways (operational activities) and means (human functions or system services), as well as the conditions ands standards under which the capability is required. Creating DoDAF architecture descriptions that are capability based and service oriented supports globalization and the integration of geographically dispersed organizations (net-centricity)},

@inproceedings{G.A.LEWIS.2007,
 abstract = {You don't have to look far to become aware of the effect that service-oriented architecture (SOA) is having on software systems. Vendors are aggressively marketing hardware, software, tools, and services that support SOA implementation within organizations as diverse as the Department of Defense, banks, federal agencies, manufacturing companies, and health care providers. Even more significantly, customers are embracing SOA as a way to successfully achieve business agility and interoperability among systems. However, our experience from working with current and potential adopters of SOA is that they often have a variety of misconceptions that lead them to oversimplify the effort required to implement SOA. Chief among these misconceptions is the belief that simply by adopting an SOA strategy for the enterprise, an organization has established a well-crafted architecture that will help the organization achieve its many IT goals. In reality, SOA is not an architecture, but an architectural pattern from which an infinite number of architectures can be derived - both good and bad. In this experience report, we discuss at a high level this and several other misconceptions about SOA derived from our experiences},
