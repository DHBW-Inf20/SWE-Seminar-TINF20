@book{Humble.2018,
 abstract = {{\textquotedbl}Does technology actually matter? And how can we apply technology to drive business value? For years, we've been told that the performance of software delivery teams doesn't matter-that it can't provide a competitive advantage to our companies. Through four years of groundbreaking research, Dr. Nicole Forsgren, Jez Humble, and Gene Kim set out to find a way to measure software delivery performance-and what drives it-using rigorous statistical methods. This book presents both the findings and the science behind that research. Readers will discover how to measure the performance of their teams, and what capabilities they should invest in to drive higher performance.{\textquotedbl}},

 abstract = {Es stehen mittlerweile mehrere IaC-Tools zur Verf{\"u}gung, um die Bereitstellung und Konfiguration der Cloud-Infrastruktur zu automatisieren. Mit der F{\"u}lle an Auswahlm{\"o}glichkeiten gestaltet sich der Auswahlprozess f{\"u}r das geeignete IaC-Tool zunehmend schwieriger. Zus{\"a}tzlich mangelt es an einer Entscheidungshilfe f{\"u}r den Auswahlprozess des geeigneten IaC-Tools. Wir glauben, dass eine Entscheidungshilfe f{\"u}r den Auswahlprozess des IaC-Tools dazu beitragen kann, bei der Cloud Migration von Anwendungen einen besseren Service zu bieten. Daher zielt diese Forschungsarbeit darauf ab, den Auswahlprozess zu unterst{\"u}tzen, indem eine Hilfestellung bei der Auswahl des richtigen IaC-Tools gegeben wird.},
