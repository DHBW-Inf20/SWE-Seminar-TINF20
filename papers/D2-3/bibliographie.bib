 abstract = {By analyzing the classes of errors that people make with systems, it is possible to develop principles of system design that minimize both the occurrence of error and the effects. This paper demonstrates some of these principles through the analysis of one class of errors: slips of action. Slips are defined to be situations in which the user's intention was proper, but the results did not conform to that intention. Many properties of existing systems are conducive to slips; from the classification of these errors, some procedures to minimize the occurrence of slips are developed.},

 abstract = {Heuristic evaluation is an informal method of usability analysis where a number of

evaluators are presented with an interface design and asked to comment on it. Four

experiments showed that individual evaluators were mostly quite bad at doing such

heuristic evaluations and that they only found between 20 and 51{\%} of the usability

problems in the interfaces they evaluated. On the other hand, we could aggregate the

evaluations from several evaluators to a single evaluation and such aggregates do

rather well, even when they consist of only three to five people.},

 abstract = {For 11 studies, we find that the detection of usability problems as a function of number of users tested or heuristic evaluators employed is well modeled as a Poisson process. The model can be used to plan the amount of evaluation required to achieve desired levels of thoroughness or benefits. Results of early tests can provide estimates of the number of problems left to be found and the number of additional evaluations needed to find a given fraction. With quantitative evaluation costs and detection values, the model can estimate the numbers of evaluations at which optimal cost/benefit ratios are obtained and at which marginal utility vanishes. For a ``medium'' example, we estimate that 16 evaluations would be worth their cost, with maximum benefit/cost ratio at four.},

in absolute numbers. Usability heuristics relating to exits and user errors were more

difficult to apply than the rest, and additional measures should be taken to find

problems relating to these heuristics. Usability problems that relate to missing interface

elements that ought to be introduced were more difficult to find by heuristic evaluation

In an initial stage, we evaluated the chosen website with a Web accessibility and usability automatic tool called SortSite; after that, we performed a manual evaluation to verify each previously detected error and present possible solutions to overcome those faults. In a third phase, three usability specialists have been used to perform a heuristic evaluation of the chosen website. Finally, user tests with blind people were carried out in order to fully assess the compliance with accessibility and usability guidelines and standards. The results showed that the platform had a good score regarding the automatic evaluation; however, when the heuristic and manual evaluations were performed, some accessibility and usability problems were discovered. Moreover, the user test results showed bad marks regarding efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction by the group of participants. As a conclusion, we highlight user interaction problems and propose seven recommendations focused on enhancing accessibility and usability of not only the evaluated e-commerce website, but also of other similar ones.},

Given that context, it is understandable how much acceptance open-source platforms had received for new businesses, with their lower costs and open community support. Facing this growth in the e-commerce domain, the relevance of usability is even more significant. For this reason, metrics that can be used to determine whether a software product meets the appropriate level of usability are needed. However, the traditional metrics fail to cover all aspects that these open-source platforms. Because of that, this article presents a systematic review to identify metrics that can measure the degree of usability. It also shows the most reported aspects that are needed to measure in e-commerce websites based on open-source platforms.},
