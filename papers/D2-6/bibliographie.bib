 abstract = {Network-based cloud computing is rapidly expanding as an alternative to conventional office-based computing. As cloud computing becomes more widespread, the energy consumption of the network and computing resources that underpin the cloud will grow. This is happening at a time when there is increasing attention being paid to the need to manage energy consumption across the entire information and communications technology (ICT) sector. While data center energy use has received much attention recently, there has been less attention paid to the energy consumption of the transmission and switching networks that are key to connecting users to the cloud. In this paper, we present an analysis of energy consumption in cloud computing. The analysis considers both public and private clouds, and includes energy consumption in switching and transmission as well as data processing and data storage. We show that energy consumption in transport and switching can be a significant percentage of total energy consumption in cloud computing. Cloud computing can enable more energy-efficient use of computing power, especially when the computing tasks are of low intensity or infrequent. However, under some circumstances cloud computing can consume more energy than conventional computing where each user performs all computing on their own personal computer (PC).},

 abstract = {This is the first book that presents a comprehensive overview of sustainability aspects in software engineering. Its format follows the structure of the SWEBOK and covers the key areas involved in the incorporation of green aspects in software engineering, encompassing topics from requirement elicitation to quality assurance and maintenance, while also considering professional practices and economic aspects. The book consists of thirteen chapters, which are structured in five parts. First the {\textquotedbl}Introduction{\textquotedbl} gives an overview of the primary general concepts related to Green IT, discussing what Green in Software Engineering is and how it differs from Green by Software Engineering.~Next {\textquotedbl}Environments, Processes and Construction{\textquotedbl} presents green software development environments, green software engineering processes and green software construction in general. The third part, {\textquotedbl}Economic and Other Qualities,{\textquotedbl} details models for measuring how well software supports green software engineering techniques and for performing trade-off analyses between alternative green practices from an economic perspective. {\textquotedbl}Software Development Process{\textquotedbl} then details techniques for incorporating green aspects at various stages of software development, including requirements engineering, design, testing, and maintenance. In closing, {\textquotedbl}Practical Issues{\textquotedbl} addresses the repercussions of green software engineering on decision-making, stakeholder participation and innovation management. The audience for this book includes software engineering researchers in academia and industry seeking to understand the challenges and impact of green aspects in software engineering, as well as practitioners interested in learning about the state of the art in Green in Software Engineering.

 abstract = {In recent years, energy efficiency has become a major focus of data centre designers and operators. This has predominantly been due to the rising cost of energy and the exponential increase in the absolute energy consumption of data centres. As carbon taxes, emissions trading and environmental imperatives become an increasing influence in the regions in which data centres are based, measuring and controlling the emissions resulting from the energy consumed in a data centre will become as important as controlling the energy consumption itself. In this paper, two bodies of research are investigated: granular energy monitoring in data centres and electricity generation emissions calculation. We propose a method to accurately calculate the emissions caused by a single piece of computation by correlating the two areas. It is shown that a saving of 45{\%} of the resultant emissions of scheduling a piece of computation can be made by choosing one of two contrasting times with different marginal power plants on the Irish electricity grid. This saving increases to over 99{\%} at times when wind generation is being curtailed.},

However, adoption of cloud computing platforms and services by the scientific community is in its infancy as the performance and monetary cost-benefits for scientific applications are not perfectly clear. This is especially true for desktop grids (aka volunteer computing) applications. We compare and contrast the performance and monetary cost-benefits of clouds for desktop grid applications, ranging in computational size and storage. We address the following questions: (i) What are the performance tradeoffs in using one platform over the other? (ii) What are the specific resource requirements and monetary costs of creating and deploying applications on each platform? (iii) In light of those monetary and performance cost-benefits, how do these platforms compare? (iv) Can cloud computing platforms be used in combination with desktop grids to improve cost-effectiveness even further? We examine those questions using performance measurements and monetary expenses of real desktop grids and the Amazon elastic compute cloud.},

Can software teams comprehend how green are their projects? Here we provide an industry perspective on why this is a challenging and worthy problem that needs to be addressed.

Green IT represents a dramatic change in priority in the IT industry. So far, the industry has been focusing on IT equipment processing power and associated equipment spending. It's not been concerned with other requirements such as power, cooling, and data center space. However, going forward, the IT industry will need to deal with all of the infrastructure requirements and the environmental impact of IT and its use. The challenges of green IT are immense; however, recent developments indicate that the IT industry has the will and conviction to tackle our environmental issues head-on. The IT sector and users must develop a positive attitude toward addressing environmental concerns and adopt forward-looking, green-friendly policies and practices.},

By 2030, data centers alone will already consume some 10{\%} of the global electricity.1 Including the Internet, telecommunications, and embedded devices, the energy consumption will be one-third of the global demand. Understanding that end users only consume what we offer, it is the community of software developers who must become active in ecologic behaviors. Green IT is the call of today. Each single line of code that we develop today may still be running years from now on zillions of processors, eating energy and contributing to global climate change.},

 urldate = {24.11.2022},
 abstract = {Cloud Computing (deutsch Rechnerwolke oder Datenwolke) beschreibt ein Modell, das bei Bedarf -- meist {\"u}ber das Internet und ger{\"a}teunabh{\"a}ngig -- zeitnah und mit wenig Aufwand geteilte Computerressourcen als Dienstleistung, etwa in Form von Servern, Datenspeicher oder Applikationen, bereitstellt und nach Nutzung abrechnet. Angebot und Nutzung dieser Computerressourcen ist definiert und erfolgt in der Regel {\"u}ber eine Programmierschnittstelle (API) bzw. f{\"u}r Anwender {\"u}ber eine Website oder App.Das National Institute of Standards and Technology definiert f{\"u}nf notwendige Merkmale f{\"u}r Cloud Computing:

On-demand self-service

Der Nutzer kann Leistungen einseitig und ohne menschliche Interaktion bei Bedarf bereitstellen lassen (Selbstbedienung).

Broad network access

Die Leistungen sind {\"u}ber das Netzwerk mit Standardmechanismen erreichbar, welche die Nutzung mit heterogenen Endger{\"a}ten wie Smartphones, Tablets, Notebooks oder Workstations f{\"o}rdern.

Resource pooling

Die Computerressourcen des Anbieters werden zusammengefasst, um mehrere Nutzer nach dem Mehrmandantenprinzip bedarfsgerecht bedienen zu k{\"o}nnen. Damit einhergehend hat der Nutzer in der Regel keine Kontrolle dar{\"u}ber, mit welchen Computerressourcen die Leistung erbracht wird (z. B. auf welchem Server oder mit welcher Datenbank).

Rapid elasticity

Die Leistung kann elastisch bereitgestellt und freigegeben werden, um bedarfsgerecht, in manchen F{\"a}llen automatisch, hoch und runter skalieren zu k{\"o}nnen. Aus Sicht des Nutzers scheinen die verf{\"u}gbaren Computerressourcen unbegrenzt und Leistungen k{\"o}nnen jederzeit in beliebiger H{\"o}he angepasst werden.

Measured service

Cloud-Systeme steuern und optimieren Computerressourcen anhand von messbaren Zahlen, die, abh{\"a}ngig von der jeweiligen Leistung, erhoben werden wie etwa Speicher, Bandbreite oder aktive Benutzerkonten. Die Nutzung der Leistung kann {\"u}berwacht, gesteuert und als Bericht bereitgestellt werden, um die Transparenz f{\"u}r den Nutzer wie auch den Anbieter gew{\"a}hrleisten zu k{\"o}nnen.Diese Definition ist heute weitgehend akzeptiert. Cloud Computing geht damit {\"u}ber andere diskutierte Ans{\"a}tze (z. B. Virtualisierung) hinaus. Unter der Bedingung einer {\"o}ffentlichen Verf{\"u}gbarkeit, {\"a}hnlich beispielsweise dem {\"o}ffentlichen Telefonnetz, kann man Cloud Computing je nach Architektur auch als Summe von Software as a Service (SaaS) und Utility Computing ansehen.},
